                <p class="display--inline-block">Harmonic Collection: 3 Ideas</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Bring three thematic ideas for your Harmonic Collection projects and be prepared to discuss them in class. Think of these potential themes as the overarching concept you’ll explore through a series of sketches.</p>
                <p class="space--after-single">Your themes should be open-ended enough to encourage a range of content, but specific enough to inspire an idea each week for twelve weeks. Some example themes include but are not limited to: your daily commute, songs you heard while walking around New York, interesting words you came across in articles this week. We’ll be starting on this project next week.</p>
